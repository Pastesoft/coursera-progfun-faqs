Community FAQs for Functional Programming Principles in Scala class on Coursera
=====================

See the class page for syllabus and enrollment details:

https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun

These FAQs were originally created during the Spring '13 run of FPP in Scala based on forum discussions, and subsequently updated during the Fall '13 and Spring '14 sessions. Note that the information may be out-of-date, as I stopped following the class after the Spring '14 session. Please submit pull requests if you find any errors or typos in the materials.

The FAQs are in Markdown variant with MathJax support used on Coursera forums.

The FAQs were at various times published with all sorts of boilerplate (links to other FAQs, requests for comments, warnings that the information might be OOD). These particular versions omit all of that, keeping just the bare bones content.

In some places it would make sense to link class materials or relevant forum threads directly. Unfortunately, these links are specific to a particular run of the class. To make maintenance easier, all such links have been removed in these versions.

All direct quotes are attributed. People who contributed directly or indirectly are too many to mention, and include a significant fraction of the forum population during the aforementioned three sessions of the class.
